# A Truly Free Software to Manage Your Personal Finance

Free Personal Finance Software (aka. FPFS) is a free program that helps you with managing your personal finance.

## Our origin story

## Our philosophies

## Why free?

We believe that good money habit is an important life skill that many people are not cultivating. As software developers and avid money people ourselves, we believe in the power of awareness, i.e. "whatever that can me measured, can be improved". In the world of software, this translate to creating tools that allow you to look behind the bank statement and hear the stories that your money is telling you.

We believe that everyone should have access to good personal finance software.

## What kind of free?

Our software is free as in free beer, i.e. with a $0 price tag. However, this is not all we mean by "free".

As hackers, we believe in openness and the power of community. Upon release, our software will also be open-sourced so that any interested parties can inspect and improve upon. The only request we make is that any modifications are also contributed back to the community (in a GPL manner).

By staying true to the idea of free, we want this project to be protected against future \_tk\_ 

## If everything is free, how do you make money?

Good question! We are glad you asked.

We are not going to shy away from revealing our masterplan of creating a sustainable business out of our passion. Here are some of our ideas moving forward (in a near future):

* We create, sell and support "power packs", which allow you to do more with the platform. For example, a feature that we planned is the capability to import transaction directly from your bank to your computer.
* We will build backend services (which cost money to run and support) that allow you to share access to the same financial account is a secure manner. For example, you can grant your accountant **read-only** access to your transactions and financial reports of one **particular time period**.
* We plan to create a marketplace where developers can share and sell plugins that extends the functionalities of our core product. We can profit by making a small commission out of every sales (everyone wins).

## Sound great! When is this available?
